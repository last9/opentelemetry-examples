# Example: NodeSelector Only (No Taints Required)
#
# Use case: You want to run components on specific nodes but your nodes are NOT tainted
# This is useful when you have labeled nodes for organization but no taints
#
# This example shows you can use the tolerations feature JUST for nodeSelector
# without requiring any taints on your cluster
#
# Usage:
#   1. Label your nodes (no tainting required):
#      kubectl label nodes node1 node2 monitoring=true
#
#   2. Run installation:
#      ./last9-otel-setup.sh tolerations-file=examples/tolerations-nodeSelector-only.yaml \
#        token="xxx" endpoint="xxx" monitoring-endpoint="xxx" username="xxx" password="xxx"
#
# Note: If you don't have taints, you can leave tolerations as empty array

# No tolerations needed if nodes are not tainted
tolerations: []

# Only use nodeSelector to target specific nodes
nodeSelector:
  monitoring: "true"

# node-exporter should run on ALL nodes (no restrictions)
nodeExporterTolerations: []
