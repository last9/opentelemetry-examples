# Example 4: Multiple tolerations for complex scenarios
#
# Use case: Mixed node types with multiple taints
# Components need to tolerate multiple taints to schedule properly
#
# Usage:
#   ./last9-otel-setup.sh tolerations-file=examples/tolerations-multi-taint.yaml \
#     token="xxx" endpoint="xxx" monitoring-endpoint="xxx" username="xxx" password="xxx"

# Multiple tolerations for different scenarios
tolerations:
  # Monitoring nodes
  - key: "monitoring"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoSchedule"

  # Control plane nodes
  - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"

  # GPU nodes (if monitoring GPU workloads)
  - key: "nvidia.com/gpu"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"

  # NoExecute for critical operations
  - key: "dedicated"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "monitoring"
    effect: "NoExecute"

# Target monitoring nodes specifically
nodeSelector:
  monitoring: "true"

# node-exporter needs to run everywhere for complete visibility
nodeExporterTolerations:
  - operator: "Exists"
