# Example 5: Tolerations without nodeSelector
#
# Use case: Tolerate taints but don't restrict to specific nodes
# Useful when you have taints for resource guarantees but want flexible scheduling
#
# Usage:
#   ./last9-otel-setup.sh tolerations-file=examples/tolerations-no-selector.yaml \
#     token="xxx" endpoint="xxx" monitoring-endpoint="xxx" username="xxx" password="xxx"

# Tolerate the taint but allow scheduling on any node
tolerations:
  - key: "workload"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "system"
    effect: "NoSchedule"

# Empty nodeSelector means no restrictions, Kubernetes will schedule anywhere
nodeSelector: {}

# node-exporter tolerates all taints
nodeExporterTolerations:
  - operator: "Exists"
