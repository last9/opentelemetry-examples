# Example 1: Run on dedicated monitoring nodes
#
# Use case: You have nodes with taint monitoring=true:NoSchedule
# All OpenTelemetry and monitoring components will run only on these nodes
#
# Usage:
#   ./last9-otel-setup.sh tolerations-file=examples/tolerations-monitoring-nodes.yaml \
#     token="xxx" endpoint="xxx" monitoring-endpoint="xxx" username="xxx" password="xxx"

# Applied to: Operator, Collector, Prometheus, Kube-State-Metrics, Prometheus Operator, Kube-Operator
tolerations:
  - key: "monitoring"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoSchedule"

# Node selector to ensure pods only run on monitoring nodes
nodeSelector:
  monitoring: "true"

# node-exporter needs to run on ALL nodes (not just monitoring nodes)
# This ensures metrics are collected from every node in the cluster
nodeExporterTolerations:
  - operator: "Exists"
