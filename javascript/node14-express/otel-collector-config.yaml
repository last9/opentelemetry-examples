# OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration with Tail-Based Sampling
#
# This configuration enables intelligent sampling that keeps:
# - 100% of traces with errors
# - 100% of slow traces (latency > 2s)
# - 10% of remaining traces (probabilistic)
#
# Trade-offs:
# - Requires Collector infrastructure
# - Higher memory usage (holds traces until decision_wait expires)
# - More accurate sampling for production debugging
